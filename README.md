Legends of Dota
=====

**Support the innovators not the imitators.**

###About###
 - Pick your skills to build an overpowered masterpiece!
 - Test out different combinations!
 - Create unique and creative heros to dominate your opponent.

###Compiling Legends of Dota###
 - This gamemode has a huge chunk generated by scripts
 - This gamemode has files that are relevant to different versions of the mod, and hence, should not be distrubuted with every version
 - You will need node.js installed
 - Copy `script_generator/settings_example.json` to `script_generator/settings.json` and fill in the `dotaDir` location, this is the path to your `dota 2 beta`, ending in a slash (/) -- Do not use backslashes
 - You will need to stage the directories, this creates virtual links to all the files, one for each build we offer, to do this, simply run `stage.bat` (this might need admin permissions)
 - `compile.bat` is used to compile script changes in the script_generator folder, you do not need to restage the changes

###Can I translate this into my language?###
 - Yes!
 - Open `script_generator/CUSTOM/addon_<your langage>.txt`
 - You can reference `addon_english.txt`
 - You might need to save it as unicode, if non standard characters are used
 - Any strings you don't fill in, will be auto copied in from the english file anyways when the gamemode is compiled
 - Note to Ash47: You need to add new languages to the `stage.bat` file!
