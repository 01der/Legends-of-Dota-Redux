Legends of Dota
=====

**Support the innovators not the imitators.**

##IMPORTANT##
 - This repo is currently DEAD
 - Over the coming weeks, this repo will be refactored, and LoD will be built from the ground up using the new modding API
 - Ash47's source1 servers have been closed and will not reopen
 - The workshop version of LoD will be disabled until it is stable using the new modding API
 - Do not create any more issues until the refactor is complete, as, they are useless issues

###About###
 - Pick your skills to build an overpowered masterpiece!
 - Test out different combinations!
 - Create unique and creative heros to dominate your opponent.

###How do I toggle between skill sets?###
 - This can be done only when the slot count is more than 6
 - The following console commands exist
  - `lod_toggle_set` Which simply toggles between the sets
  - `lod_show_set` Which takes either 0 or 1 as an argument, and will show that set
 - There is also a button located on the GUI to toggle the slots

###Compiling Legends of Dota###
 - This gamemode has a huge chunk generated by scripts
 - This gamemode has files that are relevant to different versions of the mod, and hence, should not be distrubuted with every version
 - You will need node.js installed
 - Copy `script_generator/settings_example.json` to `script_generator/settings.json` and fill in the `dotaDir` location, this is the path to your `dota 2 beta`, ending in a slash (/) -- Do not use backslashes
 - You will need to stage the directories, this creates virtual links to all the files, one for each build we offer, to do this, simply run `stage.bat` (this might need admin permissions)
 - `compile.bat` is used to compile script changes in the script_generator folder, you do not need to restage the changes

###Can I translate this into my language?###
 - Yes!
 - Open `script_generator/CUSTOM/addon_<your langage>.txt`
 - You can reference `addon_english.txt`
 - You might need to save it as unicode, if non standard characters are used
 - Any strings you don't fill in, will be auto copied in from the english file anyways when the gamemode is compiled
 - Note to Ash47: You need to add new languages to the `stage.bat` file!
